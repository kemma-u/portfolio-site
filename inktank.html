          <p>InkTank was a single person project completed as part of
            CareerFoundry’s UX Immersion course. The intent of the project and
            curriculum were to fully immerse the student in the UX Design process.
            This included learning all the skills, tools and processes of a UX
            Designer and to apply them while completing a design project from
            start to finish within the context of building a responsive app.
            InkTank is a mobile application used to help people in their tattoo
            decision process. The application is designed for people who are
            interested in getting tattoos or people who already have tattoos.
            Some features the application includes are browsing images and
            artists, locating nearby tattoo shops as well as searching for tattoo
            designs. The process included creating a competitive
            analysis, interviewing potential users to gain insight, creating user
            personas, then creating low- to mid- to high-fidelity wireframes to get
            to the final prototype.</p>

              </div>
              <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
              <p>Our users need a way to explore inspiration for tattoo designs
                based on personal preferences like artist and style because getting
                a tattoo is an incredibly personal experience that lasts, whether
                seen or unseen by others, a lifetime.</p>
              <h3>Potential Solutions</h3>
              <p>We believe that creating an app that will help users in their
                tattoo decision process will decrease the stress of deciding on
                what tatoo the user wants, the sress of finding the right artist
                for them, and any regret the user may develop overtime. The
                tattoo app will be photo-concentrated and will also include
                a map to help the user find their right artist and tattoo shop
                location(s). This app will help inspire people, help them make
                well-informed decisions, and find the perfect artist match for
                the user.</p>

          <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
          <p>To understand the current market, a competitive analysis was
            conducted. The two competitors we used to compare were
            <a href="http://www.inkhunter.tattoo/" target="_blank">INKHUNTER</a>
            and <a href="https://www.tattoodo.com/" target="_blank">Tattoodo</a>.
            The Competitive Analysis provided an informative insight about the
            already existing competitors on the market, as well served as the
            basis for setting up user stories.</p>
          <img src="images/inktank/inktank_SWOT.png" alt="InkTank SWOT">
          <div>

          <h3>Research</h3>
          <p>User interviews were conducted to gain a better understanding of
            the user’s needs and goals, their pain points, and any current
            applications they are using for their tattoo decision process.</p>
            <h4>Objective</h4>
            <p>To gain insights into the wants of users to better understand
              how people decide on moving forward in the tattoo decision process
              and where they find their inspiration for their next tattoo.</p>
              <h4>Research Goals</h4>
              <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>To learn how people decide on finally getting a tattoo.</li>
                  <li>To learn how people explore inspiration for tattoos.</li>
                  <li>To better understand how people decide on which artist is right for them.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
            <!--<p>One of the first steps in the design process was creating a
              Competitive Analysis. The two competitors we used to compare were
              <a href="http://www.inkhunter.tattoo/" target="_blank">INKHUNTER</a>
              and <a href="https://www.tattoodo.com/" target="_blank">Tattoodo</a>.
              The Competitive Analysis provided an informative insight about the
              already existing competitors on the market, as well served as the
              basis for setting up user stories.</p>
            <p>Next was creating User Stories to help define the needs and goals
              of potential users of the InkTank app. This included setting up
              scenarios for the login/sign up process, the onboarding process,
              and any features I wanted to include in the InkTank app.</p>
            <p>An additional part of the research process was interviewing
              potential users. The objective of this was to gain insights into
              the wants of users to better understand how people decide on moving
              forward in the tattoo decision process and where they find their
              inspiration for their next tattoo.</p>
            <p>Based on the research obtained from the Competitive Analysis and
              User Interviews, I was then able to create User Personas to protray
              my target users for my product. With these User Personas, I was also
              able to create User Flows to help myself imagine a user using my app.
              Here, I was able to see an end-to-end process flow.</p>-->

              <li>Relook at the Search screen and see where adjustments can be made to get rid of unnecessary white space.</li>
              <li>Review text size is consistent throughout the app.</li>
              <li>Possibly add a call icon on the Search Results screen.</li>
