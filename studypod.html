          <p>StudyPod was a single person project completed as part of CareerFoundry’s UX
            Fundamentals course. The goal of the project was to immerse the student into the initial
            design process and to be introduced into important terms, tools, and techniques in the
            field of user experience design. StudyPod is a mobile application used to help people
            learn new or existing vocabulary words for their educational or personal growth
            purposes. Some features of the application include being able to create study decks as
            well as being able to listen to the user’s curated study decks on-the-go. The process
            included creating a competitive analysis, interviewing users, creating a user persona,
            creating various user flows, creating low to mid fidelity wireframes, and conducting
            usability tests.</p>

          <h1>My Process</h1>
          <h2>Research</h2>
          <hr class="short">
          <p>One of the first steps in the design process was creating a
            Competitive Analysis. The three competitors we used to compare were
            <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" target="_blank">Duolingo</a>,
            <a href="https://www.studyblue.com/" target="_blank">StudyBlue</a>
            and <a href="https://quizlet.com/" target="_blank">Quizlet</a>.
            The Competitive Analysis provided an informative insight about the
            already existing competitors on the market, as well served as the
            basis for setting up user stories.</p>
          <p>Next was conducting user interviews. I interviewed 4 different
            people where I asked questions regarding how they study and if they
            use any apps or services to help them study. This helped me get a
            better idea and understanding of how someone's environment and what
            they could be specifically studying can affect with how they
            study. Using this information let me decide on how I wanted to
            layout my study app.</p>
          <p>Based on the research obtained from the Competitive Analysis and
            User Interviews, I was then able to create a User Persona to protray
            my target users for my product. With the User Persona, I was also
            able to create User Flows to help myself imagine a user using my app.
            Here, I was able to see an end-to-end process flow.</p>
